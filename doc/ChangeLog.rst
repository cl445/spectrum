Sept 2012
----------
* 0.5.5:
    * fix name of the libraries for mac and windows
    * change setup to manage version properly.


March 2012
--------------
* 0.5.3: add poly2lsf and lsf2poly, add tests, fix bug related to compilation of mydpss.cc
* 0.5.2: add pmtm

February 2012
--------------
* 0.5.1: add dpss wtapering windows
* 0.5.0:
   * NPSD replaced by NFFT (qlso not correct for ARMA methods that do not have NFFT since not fourier)

January 2012
---------------

October 2011
-----------------

* 0.4.4: Start to provide the library on the web www.assembla.com


May 2011
----------

* 0.3.19: add linear_prediction module with codecs (eg. ac2poly, poly2rc....)
* 0.3.18 fix bug in levinson (Real data case only) and add ac2poly function.
* 0.3.17: validation of the modcovar algorithm versus the new arcovar_simplified function.
* 0.3.16: add a simplified version of arcovar called arcovar_simplified. It is 10 times faster and with a different algorithm provides the same results as arcoar, which validates the two codes!
* 0.3.15: add corrmtx function. Tested it within music algorithm
* 0.3.14: cleanup the eigen and music methods by moving the automatic order selection outside the functions.
* 0.3.13: Add AIC and MDL criteria to deal with automatic eigen values selection in pmusic and pev
